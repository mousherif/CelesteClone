# Celeste Clone
This was the first project I had ever made in Unity. The goal was to make a 2D platformer before moving on to my later FPS project, known as Stellarscape, which you can find on my GitHub profile.

All scripts and stuff were pushed to the master branch for some goofy reason. Probably because I forgor to use "git push origin main" and just did "git push" with no branch specified :/
